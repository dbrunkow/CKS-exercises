### Can I PR? There is an error/an alternative way/an extra question/solution I can offer

Absolutely! Feel free to PR and edit/add questions and solutions, but please stick to the existing format. Give credit where credit is due. This format is from https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises. It helped me so much in my CKAD that I use it for other exams. Thank you dgkanatsios.
